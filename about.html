      <h1>MGS Sports Day Website: About</h1>
      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>This website was developed to allow spectators of the Manchester Grammar School's annual Senior Sports Day to view results, events, and competitors in these events. It is a collaborative effort between the Computer Science and PE departments of the school, the staff responsible in each department being Mr D Millington and Mr T Grainger respectively. It is hoped that students, parents and staff will find this website beneficial.</p>
