      <h1>MGS Sports Day: About</h1>
      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>This website was developed to allow spectators of the Manchester Grammar School's annual Senior Sports Day to view results, events, and competitors in these events. It is a collaborative effort between the Computer Science and PE departments of the school, the staff responsible in each department being Mr D Millington and Mr T Grainger respectively. It is hoped that students, parents and staff will find this website beneficial. It works by fetching score and competitor data from a Google Drive spreadsheet, and displaying it in an easy-to-use and clear fashion.</p>
      <h3>Development Credits</h3>
      <p>This website was developed by Theodore Tucker, a student of the Manchester Grammar School, under the guidance of Mr D Millington, the Head of Computer Science. This project is open source, and source code is available at the GitHub repository here: <a href="https://github.com/tti0/sportsday">https://github.com/tti0/sportsday</a>.

      <p>The development of this website would not be possible without the following open-source libraries:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Boostrap v4.0 - CSS framework (<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">http://getbootstrap.com/</a>).</li>
        <li>jQuery v3.2.1 - JavaScript library for code simplification (<a href="https://jquery.com/">https://jquery.com/</a>).</li>
        <li>Popper.JS - JavaScript library for pop-up handling (<a href="https://popper.js.org/">https://popper.js.org/</a>).</li>
        <li>Pluralize - JavaScript library to handle singular and plural noun forms depending on context (<a href="http://www.oranlooney.com/js-plural/">http://www.oranlooney.com/js-plural/</a>).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nor would development be possible without the excellent assistance (and patience) of Pal Kerecsenyi in debugging and testing JavaScript code.</p>
