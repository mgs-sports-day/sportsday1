# MGS Sports Day - Public Results Viewer

**Live version is avaliable at https://tti0.github.io/sportsday/.**

This website was developed to allow spectators of the Manchester Grammar School's annual Senior Sports Day to view results, events, and competitors in these events. It is a collaborative effort between the Computer Science and PE departments of the school, the staff responsible in each department being Mr D Millington and Mr T Grainger respectively. It is hoped that students, parents and staff will find this website beneficial. It works by fetching score and competitor data from a Google Drive spreadsheet, and displaying it in an easy-to-use and clear fashion.
