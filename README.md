# MGS Sports Day 2019 :: Public Results Viewer

*This site is currently stable, but is using testing data.*

**Development version is avaliable at https://tti0.github.io/sportsday/.**

**Production version is avaliable at https://mgssportsday.net.**

This website was developed to allow spectators of the Manchester Grammar School's annual Senior Sports Day to view results, events, and competitors in these events. It is hoped that students, parents and staff will find this website beneficial. It works by fetching score and competitor data from a Google Drive spreadsheet, and displaying it in an easy-to-use and clear fashion.

More details and license info about this project are available in index.html.
