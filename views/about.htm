<h3><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> About</h3>

<p>This website was developed to allow spectators of the Manchester Grammar School's annual Senior Sports Day to view results, events, and competitors in these events. It is a collaborative effort between the Computer Science and PE departments of the school, the staff responsible in each department being Mr D Millington and Mr T Grainger respectively. It is hoped that students, parents and staff will find this website beneficial. It works by fetching score and competitor data from a Google Drive spreadsheet, and displaying it in an easy-to-use and clear fashion.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>This website is powered by AngularJS and Google Sheets. We query a Google Sheet with lots of live data in it every time a page is loaded, using an <code>XMLHttpRequest();</code>, using the Google Sheets API v4. All calculation of scores and results occurs in Google Sheets: not on the website. (For the curious, the full, public Google Sheet is avaliable here: <a href="https://example.com">FIX ME</a>.) We then use various algorithms to compile the data into neatly laid-out tables, cross-referencing each other for easy navigation. The website is styled by Bootstrap. It's made to be as compact as possible so that it loads quickly on phones and doesn't use up 'too much data'. It's entirely responsive, and was tested mobile-first.</p>
